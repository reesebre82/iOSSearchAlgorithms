iOS Search Algorithms is a simple iOS app to display how sort functions work.

I have always seen videos and examples similar too this App developed in JavaScript, 
but I wanted to implement it into one of my favorite ways: through an iOS App!


This implementation of the sorting algorithms creates clear examples of the benefits
of using certain algorithms over others. 

The only struggle that I ran into during this Application is the speed processors run at.
At the sample size, every algorithm would complete within milliseconds. 

Unfortunately, users cannot process the change at that speed so I ended up adding a delay
at each loop to make it possible to see what is happening during the sort.



Here is a quick screen recording of the result:
